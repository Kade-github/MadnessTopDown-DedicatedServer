# MadnessTopDown-DedicatedServer

relies on [ENet-CSharp](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp)

## What is this?

This is a **half-finished** server that I made for Madness: Riot Rage, a game that is no longer in production.

## Supported things:

- Connection with a SQL Server to handle registration and logining in of accounts.
- Hashed passwords.
- A mail service integration for verifying accounts.
